Use the "Launch MithMaps" .bat to open the mod

To change the password, use the seamless folder within MithMaps, not the DEN1 folder

The mod uses the file extension '.mith', which can be added in:

C:\Users\YOUR-PC'S-NAME\AppData\Roaming\EldenRing

-

Includes custom 2v2 and 3v3 maps that take place in the DEN1 custom areas


The current maps are:

1. Redmane Battlegrounds (3v3)
2. Scriptorium Archives (2v2)
3. Seaside Stronghold (3v3)
4. Dueling Square (Now has Crystal Lake arena shape) WIP

-

3v3 features created by Molly include:

2 team types (red and blue team)

Custom setable respawn points

An ingame scoreboard

Built in kill all mobs script

Invasions now work with only other people that have the mod, invaders are now red instead of colorless like on seamless. All vanilla areas + custom areas are invadable (This can be disabled in the seamless settings in the folder within MithMaps)
